# Web 3.1
Recreating Windows 3.1 design elements in HTML, JS &amp; CSS for no reason

## Why?

Boredom

## Can I Use This?

Sure

## Can I Contribute to This?

Sure

## Can I Claim I Wrote This?

Sure (my code is released into the Public Domain)

## Can it run DOOM?

Yes

## Is this all your work?

HTML, CSS and JS are mine.

I have also included (with many thanks):

* Some [Windows 3.1 Icons](https://github.com/mRB0/many-windows-3.1-icons-in-png-format)
* [W95FA font](https://fontsarena.com/w95fa-by-fontsarena/)
* [Less Perfect DOS VGA font](https://laemeur.sdf.org/fonts/)

The software also loads jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery UI Touch Punch, JS-DOS and DOOM from 3rd party CDNs
